# Arduino OneWireCollector #

just a simple projecr developed on an Arduino Mega that

 * takes temperatures from a series of sensors
 * saves the measurements
 * displays the temperatures one by one
 * sends the measurements to a web service

still under development and tailored for my personal needs. However, feedback is very welcome!


## Ideas for expansion ##

 * maintain a list of switches
 * a switch triggers an alarm which *immediately* calls the web service
