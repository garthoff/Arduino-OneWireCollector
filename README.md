# Arduino OneWireCollector #

just a simple projecr developed on an Arduino Mega that

 * takes temperatures from a series of sensors
 * saves the measurements
 * displays the temperatures one by one
 * sends the measurements to a web service

still under development and tailored for my personal needs. However, feedback is very welcome!
